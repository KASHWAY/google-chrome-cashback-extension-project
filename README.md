# google-chrome-cashback-extension-project
Google chrome extension for cashback.
The extension was initially created for Paidwork.com and usage of the code is probably illegal, don't know, just don't copy it.
The extension can be uploaded to Google Chrome and can be used as a personal usage or can be downloaded from Google Chrome Extensions store after searching ,,Paidwork Cashback". 
What it does?
It exists as a Cashback Extension, so you go to a website and get a Cashback if the website is a shop in Extension's data storage.
It is pretty similar to alerabat.com extension or letyshops but it doesn't have all of their functionalities.
The extension was being created for about 2 months of non-constant work. I would say like total of 160 hours of work.
Of course with ups and downs and some bugs are still there.
